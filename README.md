Description: This project aims to create a 3-page website for the ATM company I work for. The precise specifications are listed below.
Technologies Used: .html, .css
Future Ideas: Be able to accept support requests from customers instead of redirecting them to our phone number.


User Stories:
As a customer, I want to be able to reach the company so that the company will fix any problems that I have.
As a field technician, I want a quick way to refer customers’ questions elsewhere so that I can lessen my time exposed on-field.
As a potential customer, I want to access the company so that I may decide whether I want the company’s products/services or not.

Acceptance Criteria:
The website contains home, support, and services pages. Brief about-us about the owner
